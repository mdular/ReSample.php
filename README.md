Lightweight class to resize image files in multiple ways

I'm not exactly a PHP specialist, but when looking for something like this i had trouble 
finding a graceful solution and ImageMagick is often times too big or unavailable.

So i had a go at at myself ;)

Suggestions and improvements - or even links that would obsolete this are welcome.

Quickstart: 
Point your webserver to the project folder and run the example script.
Look into example.php to see the magic.
